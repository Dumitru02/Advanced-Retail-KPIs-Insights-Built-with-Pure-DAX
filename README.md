ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project simulates a national retail chain with over 60 physical and online stores. It uses three years of fictional sales data to build a powerful DAX-only data model that analyzes:

* Store performance and profitability
* Customer purchasing behavior and loyalty
* Sales seasonality
* Product category efficiency
* Discount strategy performance
* Recurring sales and customer retention

All insights are powered purely by DAX logic â€” no visuals, slicers, or GUI interactions were used. The entire model is built and tested through calculated measures only.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Scenarios Covered

* Net Sales, Costs, Profit, and Profit Margin per Store / Month / Category
* Time-Based Comparisons (Month-over-Month, QTD, YTD, YoY)
* Target Achievement and "No Target" Handling
* Store Performance Classification (Underperforming, Acceptable, Performing)
* Top 10 and Bottom 5 Products by Sales and Profit
* Sales Seasonality and Peak Months
* Purchase Frequency and Average Basket Size
* Inefficient Discounts (high discount, low sales impact)
* Churn Detection â€“ Clients with no purchases in the last 6 months
